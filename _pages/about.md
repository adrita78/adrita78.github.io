I am Adrita Das, a researcher working at the intersection of machine learning, AI systems, and biomedicine. My work focuses on building scalable, principled learning architectures that are grounded in theory and efficient implementation, and applying them to challenging problems in science and health. I am particularly interested in long-context and sequence modeling, especially architectures that replace attention with fast implicit convolutional operators, such as state-space models and Hyena-style architectures. These models offer orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency while retaining strong representational power, and have shown promise across language, genomics, vision, and scientific data. My goal is to develop unified modeling frameworks that can reason across molecular, visual, and spatiotemporal data, rather than relying on domain-specific designs. 

On the systems side, I work on efficient geometric operators and kernels for scientific machine learning, with an emphasis on 3D molecular and structural data. I am interested in accelerating equivariant and graph-based models, improving long-range message passing, and enabling large-scale diffusion and generative models for molecular design that respect physical and geometric inductive biases. More broadly, I am excited about biological foundation models and multimodal generative AI trained on genomic, structural, imaging, and single-cell data. I am motivated by the potential of these models to predict, simulate, and design biological states, and to reveal how molecular perturbations propagate to cellular and tissue-level phenotypes.
