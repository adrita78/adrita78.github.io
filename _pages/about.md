Welcome to the front page of my website! I'm Adrita Das, a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a Master's in Bioengineering and Machine Learning. I previously received my Bachelor's in Bioengineering with a minor in Computer Science. During the school year, I am in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but I am originally from India. I am broadly interetsed in the field of Drug Discovery and AI. I am particularly focused on leveraging machine learning to advance protein structure modeling, protein design, structure-based drug discovery, and molecular simulation. I'm always interested in meeting new people and learning new things, so feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrita-das-6b05a615a/)!

Areas of Interest
------
Geometric Deep Learning for Molecular Design and Structure Prediction, Protein Language Modeling and Molecular Simulation

What Languages Do I Use?
------
Python, R, C++, C, Java, MATLAB

## Technical Blogs
I have a passion for consolidating my learnings, and one way I channel this enthusiasm is by writing blogs and reports on various Math and ML papers. This practice allows me to synthesize and articulate my understanding in a coherent manner, contributing to my continuous learning journey.

### [Different Generative Models for Graph-based Protein Design](https://example.com/blog_post_1)
In this blog post, I provide an introduction to geometric deep learning and its applications in molecular design and structure prediction.

### [LoRA for Protein Language Modeling](https://example.com/blog_post_2)
Explore the world of protein language modeling in this comprehensive blog post where I discuss the latest advancements and challenges in the field.

### [Molecular Dynamics Simulation: Fundamentals and Applications](https://example.com/blog_post_3)
Learn about the fundamentals of molecular dynamics simulation and its applications in drug discovery and molecular modeling.
