Welcome to the front page of my website! I'm Eric Liang, a current undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University (Class of 2022) majoring in Statistics and Machine Learning with a double major in Computer Science. Feel free to take a look around! I'm always interested in meeting new people and learning new things, so feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/liangeric321)!
