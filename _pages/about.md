Welcome to the front page of my website! I'm Adrita Das, a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a Master's in Bioengineering and Machine Learning. I previously received my bachelor's in Bioengineering with a minor in Computer Science. During the school year, I am in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but I am originally from India. I am broadly interetsed in the field of Drug Discovery and AI. I am particularly focused on leveraging machine learning to advance protein structure modeling, protein design, structure-based drug discovery, and molecular simulation. I'm always interested in meeting new people and learning new things, so feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrita-das-6b05a615a/)!
