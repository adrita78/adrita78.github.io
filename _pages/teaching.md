  * Led recitation sessions, held office hours, proctored exams, and helped grade assignments and exams.


### Project TA Mentor at Carnegie Mellon University - Fall 2023
Mentored and guided a group of students for their project on protein language modeling for the course 11-785 at CMU.

Project: Just as human language is composed of words, protein sequences consist of amino acids, forming the basis of biological processes. Understanding the relationship between a protein’s structure and function is pivotal for advancements in healthcare and biotechnology. However, the complexity of proteins, influenced by factors such as folding patterns and evolutionary variations, poses a significant challenge. Recent developments, especially in deep learning like AlphaFold, have revolu- tionized protein structure prediction, offering more accuracy even for proteins without known homologs. This work focuses on single-sequence-based prediction methods, leveraging SPOT-1D-LM for predicting protein structural properties. By integrating embeddings from pre-trained models like ESM-1b and ProteinBERT, we will enhance our understanding of proteins’ structural and functional motifs, crucial for addressing the protein-function prediction problem.
