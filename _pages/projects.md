### [Machine Learning Challenge](https://www.pralent.com/challenges/pralent-nhanes-machine-learning-challenge)
------
This was a challenge I created for the startup [Pralent](https://www.pralent.com), where I created [code](https://github.com/liangeric/NHANESdata) to clean raw data from the National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES), so that it can be directly used for machine learning.

### [Online Video Chat](https://github.com/liangeric/videochat)
------
I created an online video chatting platform that had a log in capability as well as the ability to leave and join the video call smoothly from any device (laptop, mobile, tablet, etc.)

### [Instagram and Reddit Automatic Bots] (https://github.com/liangeric/Instagram-and-Reddit-Starter)
------
I created this project to serve as a starting base for bots to do any sort of action on either Instgram or Reddit. The code is able to automatically log into either website, and do website specific actions after opening.

### [Personal Website] (https://github.com/liangeric/liangeric.github.io)
------
This is the code for this website you are viewing now! I used github.io to create a personal page that holds info about myself.
