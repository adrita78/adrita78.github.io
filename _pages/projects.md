### [Generative AI Innovation Incubator](https://genaihackathon2023.github.io/)
Created a AI-driven drug discovery platform to accelerate the process of designing novel proteins that target tau protein. Our platform allows users to select a target protein, specify the desired properties , and choose from a variety of models to generate a novel sequence. The platform also provides real-time feedback on the performance of the generated sequences, including binding affinity, inhibitory properties, and novelty. We implemented several protein language-based models such as ESM-2 with an MLM Head and PROTGPT-2 to generate novel protein sequences. We also integrated AlphaFold pipeline in our platform for structure prediction from the generated sequences. Our platform also integrates DiffDock-PP to give predictions of possible binding configurations of the generated protein and the target protein. During the course of the hackathon i learnt how to do use low-rank adaptation and efficient training on clusters.

### [Face Classification and Verification using CNN](https://github.com/adrita78/Face-Classification-and-Verification-Using-CNN)
In this kaggle challenge, worked on implementing pattern recognition problems that require
position invariance. Specifically on the problem of recognizing or verifying faces in images.
Ranked among the top 10% of the competition.[Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/11-785-s23-hw2p2-classification-slackkaggle)

### [Frame-level Speech Recognition](https://github.com/adrita78/Frame-Level-Speech-Recognition)
Implemented a multilayer perceptron for frame-level speech recognition. 

------

### [Image Registration in Medical Imaging using CNN](https://github.com/adrita78/4264-Image-Based-Computational-Modelling-and-Analysis)
Implemented a keypoint-based geometric network for the registration of medical images with dense deformations.[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/117E3J5J2_55Rfj6UVVnD7IREMEeq6m6s/view)

### [Disease Modelling and Analysis of Meningitis](https://github.com/adrita78/Disease-Modelling-and-Analysis-of-Meningitis)
Presented and implemented a summary of different computational approaches aimed at describing and modeling the effect of different factors on mortality rate of meningitis around the
world.[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YtQLfYZeEgAFzcVZtUECufzDrtFXN_qMf2x3PUgEyH4/edit#slide=id.g19ed4225715_0_88)

------

### [Game Theory in Python](https://github.com/adrita78/Game-Theory-in-Python)
Implemented several game theory models to explain the neuroscience of decision making. Simulated game theory models such as Axelrod and Chicken game in python.

------

### [Phylogenetic Relationship of Conserved and Non-Conserved Proteins across Model Organisms](https://github.com/adr780/Protein-E/blob/main/PED%20PROJECT.pdf)
This project was designed to provide the idea on how the sequence of proteins and structures
have changed overtime and adapted to the environment.
