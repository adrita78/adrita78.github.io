### [Data Analysis into Gun Violence Incidents](https://liangeric321.shinyapps.io/gunviolence/)
I used R to explore a dataset involving gun violence incidents in the US, and then used R Shiny to create an interactive dashboard featuring the data analysis that was done. The code for the R Shiny app can be found [here](https://github.com/liangeric/gunViolence). The code linked also includes the code I wrote to generate the filtered data from the original data.
