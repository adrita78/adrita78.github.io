### [Wav2Vec-U: Unsupervised Speech Recognition with GANs : Ablation Study](https://github.com/adrita78/Unsupervised-Speech-Recognition-with-GANs)

Overview: This project focuses on re-implementing and enhancing the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based unsupervised model for speech recognition, named wav2vec-U. The method introduces a novel approach to train speech recognition models without labeled data.

### [Attention-based End-to-End Speech-to-Text Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/adrita78/Speech-to-text-Deep-Neural-Network)

Implemented an attention-based system to solve a sequence-to-sequence problem.

### [Few-shot Object Detection in Valorant-a first-person Game](https://github.com/adrita78/fsod-valorant)


In this project, we applied few-shot object detection methods in Valorant, a first-person game set
in a three dimensional environment developed and published by Riot Games. [Report]

### [Speech Recognition by Predicting Phonemes](https://github.com/adrita78/Speeche-Recognition-by-Predicting-Phonemes)
Implemented RNNs and the dynamic programming algorithm, Connectionist Temporal Classification, to generate labels.

------
### [Face Classification and Verification using CNN](https://github.com/adrita78/Face-Classification-and-Verification-Using-CNN)
In this kaggle challenge, worked on implementing pattern recognition problems that require
position invariance. Specifically on the problem of recognizing or verifying faces in images.
Ranked among the top 10% of the competition. [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/11-785-s23-hw2p2-classification-slackkaggle)

### [Image Registration in Medical Imaging using CNN](https://github.com/adrita78/4264-Image-Based-Computational-Modelling-and-Analysis)
Implemented a keypoint-based geometric network for the registration of medical images with dense deformations.[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/117E3J5J2_55Rfj6UVVnD7IREMEeq6m6s/view)

------

### [Disease Modelling and Analysis of Meningitis](https://github.com/adrita78/Disease-Modelling-and-Analysis-of-Meningitis)
Presented and implemented a summary of different computational approaches aimed at describing and modeling the effect of different factors on mortality rate of meningitis around the
world.[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YtQLfYZeEgAFzcVZtUECufzDrtFXN_qMf2x3PUgEyH4/edit#slide=id.g19ed4225715_0_88)

------

### [Game Theory in Python](https://github.com/adrita78/Game-Theory-in-Python)
Implemented several game theory models to explain the neuroscience of decision making. Simulated game theory models such as Axelrod and Chicken Game in python.

------

### [Phylogenetic Relationship of Conserved and Non-Conserved Proteins across Model Organisms](https://github.com/adr780/Protein-E/blob/main/PED%20PROJECT.pdf)
This project was designed to provide the idea on how the sequence of proteins and structures
have changed overtime and adapted to the environment.
