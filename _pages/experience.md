## Research Experience
------
### MAIL LAB, Carnegie Mellon University
Research Assistant

Aug 2022 - Present

**Project1/Master’s Thesis:**
Predicting Interactions in Heterodimeric Complexes using Multimodal Data Integration: Integrating
GeomEtry-Aware Relational Graph Neural Network (GearNet)and Language Models in a Supervised Framework, with Self-supervised Insights. 

The project aims to advance the understanding of protein/subunit interactions within heterodimeric complexes by leveraging multimodal data integration and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. By predicting interactions between protein residues, the project seeks to understand the underlying biological mechanisms governing complex formation, which could have significant implications for drug discovery and therapeutic interventions. Co-author paper currently in preparation for submission to NeurIPS 2024.


### MAIL LAB, Carnegie Mellon University
Graduate Student Researcher

August 2022 - April 2023
  * Applied various shallow machine learning models to understand the dynamics of trans-membrane
  proteins such as GPCRS.Performed simulation of GPCRs using OpenMM and RL and MD simulation and
  automated it with the machine learning model.

### Molecular Chemistry Lab, Vellore Institute of Technology
Undergraduate Student Researcher

November 2018 – August 2022
  * Performed mass spectrometric analysis of the actions of AspN,LysC and GluC on some
  therapeutic antibodies to determine the length(size) distribution of polypeptides that result from
  the proteolysis of those antibodies.Used DeepPep as a tool for the analysis of MS-MS data.
  * Worked on molecular docking analysis of natural products for the inhibition of the main protease
  of SARS-Cov-2 and repurposing drugs against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2.
  * Worked on investigating the solvatochromic(fluorescence) properties of Bromophenol Blue in
  organic solvents in order to probe protein folding or protein binding studies in organic solvents.
  Performed UV-Vis spectroscopic, mass-spectrometric , FTIR and NMR spectroscopic analysis for
  carrying out this investigation.
  * Presented findings at the International Conference of Chemical Sciences and
  Nanomaterials(2019) and at 26th CRSI National Symposium on Chemistry- Royal Society of
  Chemistry (2020).

### Cellular Biomechanics Lab, Vellore Institute of Technology
Undergraduate Project Assistant

June 2019 – October 2019
  * Performed design,characterization and in vitro evaluation of thin films enriched by tannic acid
  complexed by Fe(III) ions for potential applications as wound dressing.
  * Employed techniques such as FTIR spectroscopy,SEM and UV-Vis spectroscopy for
  characterization of the films.
  * Different tests and measurements were being performed for the films including contact angle
  measurements, blood compatibility tests,platelet adhesion tests and MTS Assay. The results of
  the MTS assay were being analyzed one-way ANOVA.

### Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science
Undergraduate Summer Research Assistant

June 2019 – October 2019
  * As an undergraduate researcher, I embarked on a fascinating project on investigating the reaction
  of phenylglyoxal and arginine residues with proteins.
  * Employed the powerful tool of NMR spectroscopy, specifically using C13 and H1 NMR
  techniques
  * Conducted experiments in varying pH levels and concentrations and examined how these factors
  influenced the reaction outcome.
  * Expanded my knowledge of advanced NMR techniques such as TOCS, COSY and NOESY.Delved into NMR pulse programming which involved designing and implementing precise sequences of radiofrequency pulses to optimize data acquisition and extract maximum
  information from the samples.
